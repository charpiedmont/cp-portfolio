        <p>I was born in Bloomington, Indiana and have lived here and in the surrounding area my entire life. I took my first computer science class in 6th grade, where I learned the basics of coding in Scratch. I had a knack for fitting the pieces of logic together, and so years later I decided to take more computer science classes in high school. These classes, along with my time as a Catapult, have led me to be proficient in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

        <p>I am a rising high school senior with a 4.0 unweighted GPA and a passion for math, software development, and environmentalism. When I'm not at school, I participate in competive show choir, serve as a leader in multiple school clubs, and advocate for social change as a member of two local youth councils. I spent this summer strengthening my technology and industry skills as an intern for Nextech's Catapult.</p>

        <p>My future goals include attending a top university to major in computer science and Germanic studies. I dream of studying abroad in Germany and eventually working as a data scientist or software developer in a big city.</p>
